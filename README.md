# Python Project List
Welcome my list of Python projects. This is a collection of Python projects that I've made to hone my Python abilities and put them to use. Each project is briefly described below.

### [Bitly Filter](https://github.com/prathmeshChaudhari05/Project-List/tree/main/Bitly-Filter)
This project is a simple script that takes a **Bitly link** as input and extracts the name of the website from the link. It does this by parsing the link and extracting the domain name from it. This project is useful for understanding how to work with strings and URLs in Python.

### [Calculator](https://github.com/prathmeshChaudhari05/Project-List/tree/main/Calculator)
This project is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the operation. This project is useful for understanding how to work with mathematical operations in Python.

### [Fortune Teller](https://github.com/prathmeshChaudhari05/Project-List/tree/main/fortune-teller)
This project is a simple script that generates random fortunes for the user. It uses the `random` module in Python to select a random fortune from a list of fortunes. This project is useful for understanding how to work with random numbers and lists in Python.

### [Guess Number](https://github.com/prathmeshChaudhari05/Project-List/tree/main/guess-number)
This project is a simple game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number. The user is given a certain number of tries to guess the number, and the program gives feedback after each guess to help the user make a better guess next time. This project is useful for understanding how to work with loops, conditional statements, and random module in Python

### [Music Player](https://github.com/prathmeshChaudhari05/Project-List/tree/main/music-player)
This project is a simple music player that allows the user to play, pause, stop and resume. It uses the `pygame` module in Python to play audio files. This project is useful for understanding how to work with external modules and libraries in Python.

## How to Run this Project
To run any of the projects, simply navigate to the project directory and clone the project into your local machine then run the `requirements.txt` file to install all the required modules to execute code successfully. For example, to run the **Bitly Filter**, navigate to the Bitly-Filter directory and clone project to your local Machine. To clone any project into local machine use following command in your command line / terminal of Local Machine:
```git
git clone https://github.com/prathmeshchaudhari05/Project-List/tree/main/<project-name>
```
> Note: Don't use `<>` symbol instead type project name
